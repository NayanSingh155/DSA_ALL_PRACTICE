// Two Arrays One Product Ended
// Description

// You are given two arrays of same size stored in variables with the nameAandB

// The size of the arrays is stored in a variable with the nameN

// You have to find the product of all the numbers stored in the two arrays

// For example, consider the value stored inN = 3, andA = [1 2 3]andB = [2 3 1]

// Then, the product of the elements in the two arrays will be1*2*3*2*3*1 = 36, which is the required output


// Input
// There are multiple test cases within each test case, and they are being handled by the backend

// The first line of the input containsN, the size of the arraysAandB

// The next line contains the values stored inA

// The next line contains the values stored inB


// Output
// Print a single integer denoting the product of all the elements in both the arrays, as shown in the problem statement

// Sample Input 1 

// 1
// 3
// 1 2 3
// 2 3 1
// Sample Output 1

// 36
// Hint

// In the sample test case, the value stored inN = 3, andA = [1 2 3]andB = [2 3 1]

// Then, the product of the elements in the two arrays will be1*2*3*2*3*1 = 36, which is the required output
