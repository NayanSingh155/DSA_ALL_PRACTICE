// Matrix Prime & Composite Difference Ended
// Description

// You are given a matrix of sizeN x M. You have to find the absolute difference between the sum of prime and composite elements in the matrix.

// Input
// The first line of the input containsNandM, the dimensions of the matrix.
// The nextNlines contain M space separated integers each denoting the values of the matrix.
// Constraints

// 1 <= N, M <= 100

// 1 <= A[i][j] <= 100


// Output
// Print a single integer denoting the absolute difference between the sum of prime elements and composite elements in the matrix.

// Sample Input 1 

// 3 3
// 1 2 3 
// 4 5 6
// 7 8 9
// Sample Output 1

// 10
// Hint

// In the sample test case, the sum of prime elements which are {2,3,5,7} is 17. The sum of composite elements which are {4,6,8,9} is 27. Therefore, the absolute difference between the odd and even sum of elements is 10.
