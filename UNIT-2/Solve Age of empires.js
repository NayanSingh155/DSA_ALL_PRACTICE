// Solve Age of empires Ended
// Description

// You are playing the popular game of "Age of Empires". You are the king of the empire where you have 2N workers.

// All workers will be grouped in the association with size 2, so a total of N associations have to be formed.

// The building speed of the i-th worker is A[i].

// To make an association, you pick up 2 workers. Let the minimum building speed between both workers be x, then the association has the resultant building speed x.

// You have to print the maximum value possible of the sum of building speeds of N associations if you make the associations optimally.


// Input
// First line contains an integer N, representing the number of associations to be made.

// Next line contains 2N space separated integers, denoting the building speeds of 2N workers.

// N <= 50000

// A[i] <= 10000


// Output
// Print the maximum value possible of the sum of building speeds of all the associations.


// Sample Input 1 

// 2
// 1 3 1 2
// Sample Output 1

// 3
// Hint

// Sample1Explanation

// If you make an association using the first and third worker, and another using the second and fourth worker, each association will have 1 and 2 resultant building speed, which has a total of 3.
