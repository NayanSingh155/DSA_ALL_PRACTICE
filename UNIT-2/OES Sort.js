// OES Sort Ended
// Description

// You are given an array of non-negative integers. Your task is to sort them after separating the array into two different groups such that all the integers whose digit sum is odd are on one side and all integers whose digits sum is even on other side and each group should be sorted in increasing order.

// Look at the following example to understand clearly

// Suppose there are following integers 12, 45, 66, 100, 200. If you divide them into 2 different groups - one with digits sum as odd and other with digits sum as even then you will have 12, 45, 100 (with odd digits sum) and 66, 200 (all even digits sum). The final answer will be 12 45 100 66 200 [all odd digit sum sorted in increasing order followed by all even digit sum sorted in increasing order]

// Please note that you must NOT use a built-in sorting function anywhere. You are supposed to write your own sorting algorithm


// Input
// First-line contains n which is the number of the element present in the array


// Second-line contains n space-separated non-negative integers


// Output
// Output all integers of the array sorted in a particular fashion as given in the problem statement


// Sample Input 1 

// 8
// 121 384 103 100 200 400 757 481
// Sample Output 1

// 100 384 481 757 103 121 200 400
