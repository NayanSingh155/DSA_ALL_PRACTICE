// Bored In Vacation Ended
// Description

// Currently, your summer vacations are going on and you are bored so you decided to do something to pass your time.

// You found two strings of lowercase english letters having different lengths and you decide to create a new string from these two strings.

// So decide to create a new string c using the first two strings a and b by performing the following operations-

// Choose any character from the string a, remove it from a, and add it to the end of c.
// Choose any character from the string b, remove it from b, and add it to the end of c.
// But you decided to challenge yourself as this was too easy. You decided that you will not perform the same operation more than k times continuously and you will perform these operations until one of the strings become empty.

// Find the lexicographically smallest string you can create using these conditions.

// A string x is lexicographically smaller than a string y if and only if one of the following holds:

// x is a prefix of y, but xâ‰ y;
// in the first position where x and y differ, the string x has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in y.

// Input
// Input Format
// The first line of input contains an integer t, the total number of testcases.

// Next 3*t lines, conatain the description of the testcases.

// For each testcase there are three lines of input.

// The first line of input contains three space-separated integers- n, m, and k denoting the size of string a, string b, and k.

// The second line of input contains the string a.

// The third line of input contains the string b.

// Constraints
// 1 <=t<= 100

// 1 <=n,m,k<= 100


// Output
// Output Format
// For each test case output a single line containing the string c.


// Sample Input 1 

// 3
// 6 4 2
// aaaaaa
// bbbb
// 5 9 3
// caaca
// bedededeb
// 7 7 1
// noskill
// wxhtzdy
// Sample Output 1

// aabaabaa
// aaabbcc
// dihktlwlxnyoz
// Hint

// First Testcase
// In the first test case, it is optimal to take two 'a's from the string a and add them to the string c. Then it is forbidden to take more characters from a, hence one character 'b' from the string b has to be taken. Following that logic, we end up with c being 'aabaabaa' when string a is emptied.

// Second Testcase
// In the second test case it is optimal to take as many 'a's from string a as possible, then take as many 'b's as possible from string b. In the end, we take two 'c's from the string a emptying it.
