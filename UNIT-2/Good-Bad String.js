// Good-Bad String Ended
// Description

// We do not like strings which have same consecutive letters. No one has any idea why it is so.

// We call these strings as Bad strings. So, Good strings are the strings which do not have same consecutive letters. Now, the problem is simple. Given a string S, you need to convert it into a Good String.


// Input
// Input Format:

// The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.

// Each test case consists of a string S, which consists of only lower case letters.

// Constraints:

// 1 <= T <= 10

// 1 <= Length of string <= 30


// Output
// For each test case, print the answer to the given problem.

// The answer is the modified good string

// 3
// abb
// aaab
// ababa
// Sample Output 1

// ab
