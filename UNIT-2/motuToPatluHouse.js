// Motu to Potlu house Ended
// Description

// Motu decided to visit his friend Potlu. It turned out that the Motu's house is located at point 0 and his friend's house is located at point x (x > 0) of the coordinate line. In one step the Motu can move 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 positions forward.

// Determine, what is the minimum number of steps he need to make in order to get to his friend's house.

// Note : You have to take the input yourself

// Input
// Input Format :

// First and the only line contain the integer n which denotes the position of his friend's house.

// Constraints :

// 1 <= n <= 10^6


// Output
// Output contains a single line denoting the minimum number of steps.


// Sample Input 1 

// 26
// Sample Output 1

// 6
// Hint

// Output Explanation :

// For n = 26, Motu can move as

// 5 --> 5 --> 5 --> 5 --> 5 --> 1

// Hence he needed 6 steps to reach at position 26.
