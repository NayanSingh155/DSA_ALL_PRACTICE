Compare two Numbers Ended
Description

You are given two numbers stored in two variables, with the name,num1 and num2

Print the result of the following operations

1. num1 > num2 -> this operation prints true, if num1 is greater than num2, otherwise it prints false
2. num1 < num2 -> this operations prints true, if num1 is smaller than num2, otherwise it prints false
3. num1 == num2 -> this operation print true, if num1 is equal to num2, otherwise it prints false
You have to print the result of three operations in the order as shown above

Input
The first and the only line of input contains the values stored in num1 and num2

Output
Print the result of three operations, one by one, on a new line


Sample Input 1 

4 16 
Sample Output 1

false
true
false
Hint

In the sample test case, the value stored in num1 = 4and value stored in num2 = 16

In the first operationnum1 > num2, 4 is not greater than 16, so we get the output as false

In the second operationnum1 < num24 is lesser than 16, so we get the output as true

In the third operation's1 == num2, num1 is not equal to num2, so we get the output as false

function compareTwoNumbers(num1, num2) {
  // Write code here
  console.log(num1>num2);
  console.log(num1<num2);
  console.log(num1==num2);
}
