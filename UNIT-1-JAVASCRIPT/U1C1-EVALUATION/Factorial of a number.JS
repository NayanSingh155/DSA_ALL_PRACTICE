// Factorial of a number Ended
// Description

// You are given a positive number, stored in a variable with the namenum
// You need to find the factorial of the number.
// In simple words, the factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given positive integer.

// For example, you are given a numbernum = 5.

// According to the definition, the factorial ofnumwill be5*4*3*2*1 = 120, which is the required answer.

// Note: Factorial of 0 is 1.


// Input
// The first and the only line of the input contains the value stored in the variable with the namenum

// Output
// Print the factorial of the numbernumas mentioned in the problem.

// Sample Input 1 

// 5
// Sample Output 1

// 120
// Hint

// In the sample test case, you are given a numbernum = 5.

// According to the definition, the factorial ofnumwill be5*4*3*2*1 = 120, which is the required answer.

	//Write the code
	let fact=1;
	for(let i=num;i>=1;i--)
	{
	    fact=fact*i;
	}
	console.log(fact);
