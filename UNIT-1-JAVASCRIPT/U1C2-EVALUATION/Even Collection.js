// Even Collection Ended
// Description

// You are given two numbers, stored in variables with the following names

// max, min

// You have to find the sum of all even numbers that fall between two numbersfrom min to max(including both min and max).

// For example, if the value stored inmax = 19, and the value stored inmin = 14, then the output will be computed as follows

// sum of even = 14 + 16 + 18 = 48
// Note : The value stored in max will always be greater than or equal to min


// Input
// The first and the only line of input contains the value stored inmax, minrespectively


// Output
// print thesum of all even numbers that fall between two numbers(including both numbers)from min to max.


// Sample Input 1 

// 19 13
// Sample Output 1

// 48
// Hint

// Given max = 19, min = 13

// The range contain following number : 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

// From above range , The even numbers are : 14, 16, 18

// Sum of even numbers = 14 + 16 + 18 = 48

function evenCollection(max,min){
    var sum=0;
    for(var i=min;i<=max;i++){
        if(i%2==0){
            sum=sum+i;
        }
    }
    console.log(sum)
}
