// Product of VIII Ended
// Description

// You are given eight numbers, stored in variables with the following names

//  one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
// Print the product of all the eight numbers

// Input
// The first and the only line of the input contains 8 numbers stored in the variablesone, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

// Constraints

// 1 <= N <= 20


// Output
// Print a single integer, denoting the product of the eight numbers given.


// Sample Input 1 

// 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
// Sample Output 1

// 40320
// Hint

// In the sample test case, the value of the variables is as follows

// one = 1

// two = 2

// three = 3

// four = 4

// five = 5

// six  = 6

// seven = 7

// eight = 8

// After, multiplying the eight numbers, we get the following result1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8 = 40320, which is the required answer
