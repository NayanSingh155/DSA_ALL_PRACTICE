// Operation on Numbers - 2 Ended
// Description

// You are given a number stored in a variable with the nameN, and another number stored in a variable with the nameM

// You have to perform the following operations on the value stored inN

//     Multiply the value stored in N with 40

//     Add 20 to the value stored in N

//     Subtract 50 from the value stored in N

// You are given another number stored in the variableM

// If the value after of after performing the above operations is greater thanM, printGreater!, else if the value is equal, printEqual!, else printLesser!

// For example, consider the value stored inN= 5, and the value stored inM= 10

// Then, after performing the above operation, the value stored inNbecomes

//      N = N * 40 = 200

//      N = N + 20 = 220

//      N = N - 50 = 170
// Now, the value stored inMis 10, which is lesser than the value stored inN. Therefore, the output isGreater!

// Input
// The first and the only line of the input contains the value stored inNandM

// Output
// Print the output according to the condition shown in the problem statement

// Sample Input 1 

// 5 10
// Sample Output 1

// Greater!
// Hint

// In the sample test case, consider the value stored inN = 5, and the value stored inM = 10

// Then, after performing the above operation, the value stored inNbecomes
//      N = N * 40 = 200

//      N = N + 20 = 220

//      N = N - 50 = 170
// Now, the value stored inMis 10, which is lesser than the value stored inN. Therefore, the output isGreater!
